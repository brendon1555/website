title: From Wordpress to Jekyll
---

I have finally made the move from Wordress to Jekyll. I figured for the small amount of use that this gets, Wordpress was major overkill and Jekyll does everything I would ever need.

Now I just need to get used to Markdown...

For those interested the Jekyll theme I am using is caled Hyde. Which you can check out [Here](https://github.com/poole/hyde).

title: From Wordpress to Jekyll

I have finally made the move from [Wordress](https://wordpress.org) to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). I figured for the small amount of use that this gets, Wordpress was major overkill and Jekyll does everything I would ever need.

Wordpress just felt really bloated and small customisations to the theme felt like mission impossible. Not to mention I dont need a database anymore.

Also... \***cough**\* php \***cough**\*

Now I just need to get used to Markdown...

For those interested the Jekyll theme I am using is called Hyde. Which you can check out [Here](https://github.com/poole/hyde).
